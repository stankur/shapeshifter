# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and documentation of core concepts for an idea transformation and publishing platform.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented user authentication system
   - Added profile tables and security policies in Supabase
   - Created UsernameInput component for auth UI
2. Enhanced section containers
   - Implemented Table of Contents component
   - Added Tabs interface
   - Created Card view
   - Added TabShadcn view using ShadCN UI components
3. Improved document structure
   - Added collection model and actions
   - Implemented document utilities
   - Added document titles and slugs
   - Created TitleInput component
4. Set up route handling
   - Added dynamic document routes
   - Configured layout components
   - Prepared for username/slug-based URLs
5. Integrated ShadCN UI components
   - Added ShadCN Tabs component
   - Updated model schema to support TabShadcn view
   - Added navigation between views

## Active Decisions
1. **Authentication & Security**
   - Using Supabase auth with custom profiles
   - Implementing row-level security policies
   - Managing user-specific content access
   - Enforcing unique document titles per user

2. **Document Organization**
   - Hierarchical section containers
   - Flexible view types (Cards, Tabs, TOC)
   - Collection-based document structure

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Modular section containers
   - Reusable control components
   - Utility-first styling with Tailwind

## Current Challenges
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Optimizing user onboarding
   - Managing auth state across routes
   - Handling auth-specific UI states
   - Ensuring unique document identifiers

2. **Document Organization**
   - Complex nested section relationships
   - State management across components
   - Real-time content synchronization

3. **Component Integration**
   - Coordinating section containers
   - Managing component lifecycles
   - Optimizing performance

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication**
   - [ ] Complete user profile management
   - [ ] Implement role-based access
   - [ ] Add social auth providers

2. **Document System**
   - [ ] Enhance section container interactions
   - [ ] Implement advanced view transitions
   - [ ] Add drag-and-drop organization

3. **Component Features**
   - [ ] Add more section container types
   - [ ] Implement advanced controls
   - [ ] Optimize component performance

## Open Questions
1. How to optimize the auth flow for different user types?
2. What additional section container types would be most useful?
3. How to handle complex nested section relationships?
4. What performance optimizations are needed for large documents?

## Current Sprint
- Completing authentication system
- Enhancing section containers
- Optimizing document organization
- Implementing advanced controls
