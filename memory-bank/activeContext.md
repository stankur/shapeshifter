# Active Context

## Current Focus
We're implementing an AI-generated summary feature for the document editor. This feature will allow users to generate summaries of their content using Claude 3.7 via OpenRouter, with the results streaming back to the UI in real-time.

## Implementation Approach
We're breaking this down into multiple phases:

### Phase 1: Create a Streaming Mock Endpoint
- Create a new API endpoint in SvelteKit that simulates streaming responses
- Implement a mock response that sends chunks of text with delays to mimic LLM streaming
- Ensure proper content-type and headers for streaming
- Test the streaming functionality without external dependencies

### Phase 2: Add Generate Button to Summary Panel
- Update the SummaryContainer component with a "Generate Summary" button
- Implement click handler to call the streaming endpoint
- Create a function to consume the streaming response
- Update the summary content incrementally as chunks arrive
- Handle loading states, errors, and completion

## Technical Details
- The summary feature will build on the existing summary functionality in the Write mode
- Currently, summaries are manually written by users in the summary section
- We'll add the ability to generate these summaries automatically
- The streaming approach will provide immediate feedback to users as the summary is being generated

## Integration Points
- The SummaryContainer component in `src/lib/view/collection/section/write/SummaryContainer.svelte`
- The Write component in `src/lib/view/collection/section/write/Write.svelte`
- The document model's summary array in each section

## Previous Work Context
We previously implemented a path-based component access pattern to replace the two-way binding approach. This change addressed issues with deeply nested objects, where two-way binding created friction when accessing state from adjacent components. The new approach uses a centralized global reactive state accessed through paths.

1. Enhanced DocumentManipulator
   - Created a centralized document state accessible via paths
   - Implemented `getByPath` function to access nodes by path
   - Leveraged Svelte 5's reactivity for direct mutations

2. Updated component props
   - Changed component props from `node` to `path`
   - Components now receive paths instead of direct node references
   - Child components receive extended paths (e.g., `[...path, 'children', index]`)

3. Maintained reactivity
   - Components retrieve nodes using `documentManipulator.getByPath(path)`
   - Direct mutations to retrieved objects are reactive
   - No need for explicit setters due to Svelte 5's reactivity system

4. Preserved callback patterns
   - Kept existing callback patterns for actions
   - Maintained the component hierarchy pattern
   - Actions still operate on node objects directly

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 1: Create the streaming mock endpoint
- Test the streaming functionality
- Implement Phase 2: Add the generate button to the summary panel
- Integrate the streaming consumer with the UI
- Future phases will be planned based on the results of the initial implementation

## Active Decisions
- Using a streaming approach to provide immediate feedback
- Starting with a mock endpoint to establish patterns before integrating with external APIs
- Building on the existing summary functionality in the document model
- Leveraging SvelteKit's streaming response capabilities
- Following the established path-based component access pattern
