# Progress

## What Works
- Document model and structure
- Basic editing functionality
- View registry for component mapping
- Section containers (Card, TableOfContents, Tabs)
- Content components (Heading, Paragraph)
- ProseMirror integration for rich text editing
- Document actions for state management
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Editor focus management system
- Navigation between content blocks using arrow keys
- Section splitting functionality
- Paragraph-to-heading conversion
- UI controls for content transformation

## What's Left to Build
- Customizable heading levels for section splitting
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Additional content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control

## Current Status
We've implemented a section split feature that allows users to convert a paragraph into a heading and create a new section from it. This enhances the document editing experience by providing a way to better organize content and create new sections as needed.

The implementation follows a consistent pattern:
1. Actions are defined in the actions file (collection.svelte.ts)
2. Callbacks are passed down through the component hierarchy
3. UI controls trigger the actions
4. Everything is connected through the component hierarchy

We've also created comprehensive documentation in the guides folder to document the patterns used in the application, which will make it easier to add new functionality in the future.

## Known Issues
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
- Section splitting currently uses the same heading level as the parent section
