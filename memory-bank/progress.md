# Progress

## What Works

- Document model and structure
- Basic editing functionality
- View registry for component mapping
- Section containers (Card, TableOfContents, Tabs)
- Content components (Heading, Paragraph)
- ProseMirror integration for rich text editing
- Document actions for state management
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Editor focus management system
- Navigation between content blocks using arrow keys
- Section splitting functionality
- Paragraph-to-heading conversion
- UI controls for content transformation
- Heading level increase with document restructuring
- Heading level decrease with document restructuring
- Path-based component access pattern
- Backspace functionality for joining blocks (with known issues)

## What's Left to Build

- Fix UI update issues with heading level changes (currently requires mode switching)
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Additional content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control
- Debugging tools for path-based access

## Current Status

We've implemented a path-based component access pattern to replace the two-way binding approach. This change addresses issues with deeply nested objects, where two-way binding creates friction when accessing state from adjacent components.

The new approach uses a centralized global reactive state accessed through paths:

1. Components receive paths instead of direct node references
2. Components access nodes through the DocumentManipulator using `getByPath(path)`
3. Direct mutations to retrieved objects are automatically reactive
4. Child components receive extended paths (e.g., `[...path, 'children', index]`)

This pattern provides several benefits:

- Reduced coupling between components
- Simplified state management with a single source of truth
- Better performance with deeply nested structures
- Consistent access pattern across all components
- Maintained reactivity through Svelte 5's reactivity system

We've implemented document structure updates for both heading level increases and decreases:

**Heading Level Increase (Tab/Space at start of heading):**

1. Check if there's a preceding section with the appropriate level (one level lower than the new heading level)
2. If found, increase the heading level and move the section to become a child of that preceding section
3. Update the document structure accordingly

**Heading Level Decrease (Backspace at start of heading):**

1. Check if decreasing the level would violate the constraint (section cannot have direct section children whose level is more than 1 above its level)
2. If safe, perform a three-step restructuring process:
   - Step 1: Move siblings after the section to be children of that section
   - Step 2: Remove the section from its container and move children after container to the section
   - Step 3: Add the section to the grandparent section container after the parent section
3. Update the heading level and document structure

**Backspace at Start of Paragraph (Join with Previous):**

1. Detect when backspace is pressed at the start of a paragraph
2. Find the previous paragraph in the same section
3. Join the content of the current paragraph with the previous paragraph
4. Remove the current paragraph from the document
5. Set focus to the previous paragraph with cursor at the join point

This implementation required clarifying the distinction between:

- findPrecedingSection: Finds a preceding sibling section with the appropriate level
- findParentSection: Finds the actual parent section in the hierarchy
- findParentSectionContainer: Finds the container that holds the current section
- findGrandparentSectionContainer: Finds the container that holds the parent section

There is currently a UI update issue where changes don't appear immediately unless the user switches modes and goes back to write mode. This needs to be addressed in future updates.

## Known Issues

- UI update issues with heading level changes (requires mode switching to see changes)
- Edge cases in heading level increase and decrease operations
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
- Need to ensure all components are updated to use the path-based pattern
- Backspace functionality issues:
  - Empty transaction steps being logged (transaction steps: [])
  - Document being set to wrong version where content is deleted instead of joined
  - Cursor disappearing after backspace operation
  - Content that should be joined is sometimes just deleted
