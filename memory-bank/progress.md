# Progress

## What Works
- Document model and structure
- Basic editing functionality
- View registry for component mapping
- Section containers (Card, TableOfContents, Tabs)
- Content components (Heading, Paragraph)
- ProseMirror integration for rich text editing
- Document actions for state management
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Editor focus management system
- Navigation between content blocks using arrow keys
- Section splitting functionality
- Paragraph-to-heading conversion
- UI controls for content transformation
- Heading level increase with document restructuring
- Path-based component access pattern

## What's Left to Build
- Heading level decrease with document restructuring
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Additional content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control
- Debugging tools for path-based access

## Current Status
We've implemented a path-based component access pattern to replace the two-way binding approach. This change addresses issues with deeply nested objects, where two-way binding creates friction when accessing state from adjacent components.

The new approach uses a centralized global reactive state accessed through paths:

1. Components receive paths instead of direct node references
2. Components access nodes through the DocumentManipulator using `getByPath(path)`
3. Direct mutations to retrieved objects are automatically reactive
4. Child components receive extended paths (e.g., `[...path, 'children', index]`)

This pattern provides several benefits:
- Reduced coupling between components
- Simplified state management with a single source of truth
- Better performance with deeply nested structures
- Consistent access pattern across all components
- Maintained reactivity through Svelte 5's reactivity system

We've also implemented document structure updates when heading levels increase. Now when a user presses Tab or Space at the beginning of a heading, the system will:

1. Check if there's a parent section with the appropriate level (one level lower than the new heading level)
2. If found, increase the heading level and move the section to become a child of that parent section
3. Update the document structure accordingly

We still need to implement the heading level decrease functionality, which will handle the case when a heading level goes down and needs to break out of its current container, taking any subsections with higher heading levels with it.

## Known Issues
- Heading level decrease functionality not yet implemented
- Edge cases in heading level increase (e.g., first section in a document)
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
- Need to ensure all components are updated to use the path-based pattern
