# Progress

## What Works
- Document model and structure
- Basic editing functionality
- View registry for component mapping
- Section containers (Card, TableOfContents, Tabs)
- Content components (Heading, Paragraph)
- ProseMirror integration for rich text editing
- Document actions for state management
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Editor focus management system
- Navigation between content blocks using arrow keys

## What's Left to Build
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Improved content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control

## Current Status
We've implemented a cursor navigation system that allows users to move between content blocks using arrow keys. This improves the editing experience by eliminating the need to manually click on the next block after pressing Enter. The system uses an EditorFocusService to manage focus between editor instances and view-specific navigation logic to handle different container types.

The Card view has been updated to properly handle navigation between headings and summary content, reflecting its design which only shows these elements (not children). Both Paragraph and Heading components now register with the EditorFocusService when mounted and unregister when destroyed.

## Known Issues
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
