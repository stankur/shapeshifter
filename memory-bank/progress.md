# Progress

## What Works
- Document model and structure
- Basic editing functionality
- View registry for component mapping
- Section containers (Card, TableOfContents, Tabs)
- Content components (Heading, Paragraph)
- ProseMirror integration for rich text editing
- Document actions for state management
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Editor focus management system
- Navigation between content blocks using arrow keys
- Section splitting functionality
- Paragraph-to-heading conversion
- UI controls for content transformation
- Heading level increase with document restructuring

## What's Left to Build
- Heading level decrease with document restructuring
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Additional content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control

## Current Status
We've implemented document structure updates when heading levels increase. Now when a user presses Tab or Space at the beginning of a heading, the system will:

1. Check if there's a parent section with the appropriate level (one level lower than the new heading level)
2. If found, increase the heading level and move the section to become a child of that parent section
3. Update the document structure accordingly

The implementation follows the established callback propagation pattern:
1. Actions are defined in the actions file (collection.svelte.ts)
2. Callbacks are passed down through the component hierarchy
3. UI events trigger the actions
4. Everything is connected through the component hierarchy

We still need to implement the heading level decrease functionality, which will handle the case when a heading level goes down and needs to break out of its current container, taking any subsections with higher heading levels with it.

## Known Issues
- Heading level decrease functionality not yet implemented
- Edge cases in heading level increase (e.g., first section in a document)
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
