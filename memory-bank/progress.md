  - Phase 1: Create streaming mock endpoint
  - Phase 2: Add generate button to summary panel
  - Future phases: Integration with OpenRouter and Claude 3.7
- Fix UI update issues with heading level changes (currently requires mode switching)
- Complete navigation system for all view types
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Additional content transformation capabilities
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Mobile-friendly UI adaptations
- Advanced formatting options
- Image and media support
- Export functionality
- Version history and change tracking
- User permissions and access control
- Debugging tools for path-based access

## Current Status

We're implementing an AI-generated summary feature for the document editor. This feature will allow users to generate summaries of their content using Claude 3.7 via OpenRouter, with the results streaming back to the UI in real-time.

The implementation is divided into phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Current Focus)**: Create a streaming mock endpoint
   - Implement a SvelteKit API endpoint that simulates streaming responses
   - Send chunks of text with delays to mimic LLM streaming behavior
   - Ensure proper content-type and headers for streaming

2. **Phase 2**: Add generate button to summary panel
   - Update the SummaryContainer component with a "Generate Summary" button
   - Implement click handler to call the streaming endpoint
   - Create a function to consume the streaming response
   - Update the summary content incrementally as chunks arrive

This feature builds on the existing summary functionality in the Write mode, where summaries are currently manually written by users. The streaming approach will provide immediate feedback to users as the summary is being generated.

## Path-Based Component Access Pattern

We've implemented a path-based component access pattern to replace the two-way binding approach. This change addresses issues with deeply nested objects, where two-way binding creates friction when accessing state from adjacent components.

The new approach uses a centralized global reactive state accessed through paths:

1. Components receive paths instead of direct node references
2. Components access nodes through the DocumentManipulator using `getByPath(path)`
3. Direct mutations to retrieved objects are automatically reactive
4. Child components receive extended paths (e.g., `[...path, 'children', index]`)

This pattern provides several benefits:

- Reduced coupling between components
- Simplified state management with a single source of truth
- Better performance with deeply nested structures
- Consistent access pattern across all components
- Maintained reactivity through Svelte 5's reactivity system

## Backspace Functionality Issue Investigation

We've identified and diagnosed a race condition in the paragraph joining functionality:

1. **Issue Symptoms**:
   - When pressing backspace at the start of a paragraph, it should join with the previous paragraph
   - The document node shows correct joining at some point during execution
   - However, the final result shows the paragraph being deleted instead of joined

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The race condition occurs between two separate processes:
     - Direct document model updates in `joinWithPreviousParagraph`
     - ProseMirror's transaction processing in `dispatchTransaction`
   - The key issue is that `prevBlock.content` and `prevBlock.last_modified` are updated in separate steps
   - This creates a timing window where the component re-renders due to the key change (`node.children[i].last_modified + node.children[i].id`)
   - The old ProseMirror instance's transaction processing overwrites the correctly joined content with stale data

3. **Solution Plan**:
   - Implement atomic updates for content and last_modified in `joinWithPreviousParagraph`
   - Update both properties in a single operation to prevent the race condition
   - This ensures that the component re-render doesn't occur between property updates
   - Example implementation:
     ```typescript
     // Update previous block atomically
     const updates = {
       content: prevBlock.content + currentBlock.content,
       last_modified: new Date().toISOString()
     };
     Object.assign(prevBlock, updates);
     ```

## Known Issues

- UI update issues with heading level changes (requires mode switching to see changes)
- Edge cases in heading level increase and decrease operations
- Navigation between different view types needs refinement
- Some edge cases in cursor positioning when navigating between blocks
- Need to implement navigation for all container types
- Performance optimization for large documents with many editors
- Need to ensure all components are updated to use the path-based pattern
- Backspace functionality race condition (solution identified and documented)
