The extract module is used to convert our document model into other formats.

For example, we currently have the conversion of a section/section container to Markdown

The example.ts file is used to test our extraction processes. We don't currently have standardized tests for the sake of speed, however, we test it by printing out the result of extractions and verifying that the output looks about right.
