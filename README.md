sup motherfuckers hahaha

I am trying to make hard information elegant, beautiful, and understandable. I know it's been years since I initially said that, but I'd rather suffer for long for something jaw-dropping than create something basic u know. I can tolerate isolation, but I can't tolerate mediocrity.

In this iteration, the document is represented as a tree with nodes, similar to how HTML represent documents. And then I attach renderers to each type of node as plugins.

There is also an animation engine that takes care of making switching between views intuitive.
